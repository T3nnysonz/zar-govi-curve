# Comparison method

Government bond data was run through this bootstrapper with output discount factors and zero rates stored in appropriate arrays, which were then compared entry by entry to the discount factors and zero-rates provided by Murex themselves. The datasets were plotted against one another for visual comparison and the relative error of this bootstrapper's results were explicitly calculated using:

### Setup

The Murex data was provided by Lisa on the 20'th. The data provided was copied into suitable csv files: A file containing the inputs, which were to be run through my code and compared against the data in another csv file containing the Murex outputs.

$$ Error = \frac{|Expected-Actual|}{Expected}$$

## Relative Errors compared to Murex dataset

Top: relative errors of discount factors.

Bottom: relative errors of zero rates.

# Discussion:

The curves generated by this program match the curves generated by Murex well, but not exceptionally. The relative error of the **Discount Curve** remains below 3% at all times and the relative error of the **Zero Curve** does similarly. Both curves start with greater accuracy than they finish at, a natural consequence of small unidentified differences in this project's code logic versus that of Murex.

## Inputted data
A small factor that would contribute to the discrepencies between this program's results vs Murex's results is that the dataset used by Murex was tweaked slightly in order to be able to run under this code. Specifically, the maturity dates of the provided bonds in 2032 and 2033 were moved forward to 2 October of their respective years. This was done because the bootstrapper cannot bootstrap multiple coupons at once, that is it can only jump forward one cashflow at a time which is at maximum 1 year.
