# Daily Report - 2026-01-12

## Summary
- Initialised README
- Wrote docs/TVM.md
- Coded year_fraction and DF_from_rate into daycount.py
- Basic yet insufficient testing of the functions in daycount.py
- Incorrectly set up the repository

## Planned vs Done
### Planned
- Initialise the project including creating all needed files, initialising python with the correct libraries.
- Complete the coding and Documentation of daycount.py
- Gain understanding of bonds, repositories, time value of money, and differences and record the new understandings in docs/tvm.md
- Testing the completed daycount.py

### Completed
- - Initialise the project including creating all needed files, initialising python with the correct libraries.
- Complete the coding and Documentation of daycount.py
- Gain understanding of bonds, repositories, time value of money, and differences and record the new understandings in docs/tvm.md

## Progress evidence
- Repo/branch: None - Will be explained in issues
- Key commits / PRs:
  - 
- Screenshots (if UI changes):
  I as of now do not know how to attach screenshots to a markdown.

## Technical notes (what you learned / decisions made)
- When computing Difference Factors, I did not use the continuous compounding model but rather the discrete compounding model to align with the project specifications.

- Learned what a bond is
- Learned what a repository is
- Learned what TMV is
- Learned what a dscount and a discount factor in relation to bonds is

## Issues / Risks / Blockers
- Testing the code is incomplete as the testing file was unable to access the source code from another folder, temporarily resolved by moving the testing file into the src folder
- The entire project was set up in the wrong location. It is currently set up to run privately on a folder on my laptop as opposed to the online service that was requested. This was due to my personal misunderstanding of what was required. However a fix should be as simple as copying the files to the online service

## Plan for tomorrow
- Migrate the current project to the online repositry service
- fix the testing file
- Write docs/curve_concepts.md
-	Implement a curve object

## Time log (optional but encouraged)
- 09:00-11:00 - Installing the required softwares
- 11:00-13:00 - Writing tvm.md
- 14:00-17:00 - Coding and testing daycount.py
