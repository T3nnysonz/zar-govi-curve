- Prepared for tomorrow's presentation

## Planned vs Done
### Planned
- Rewrite docs
- improve swap bootstrapping

### Completed
- Rewrote docs
- Improved App UX
- Improved zero curve quality
- Made Repo public

## Progress evidence
- Repo/branch: https://github.com/T3nnysonz/zar-govi-curve
- Screenshots:
  - Help screens added for conventions and bounds

## Technical notes

- In the Murex demo I have opted to mix swaps and bonds in a section of my dataset that should be all swaps, because the hybrid yields a better curve.

## Issues / Risks / Blockers
- Still using an poor swap bootstrapping algorithm. Implementing a better one may take too much time.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Do final presentation
