# Daily Report - 2026-01-22

## Summary
- Completed final report
- Marginally improved results

## Planned vs Done
### Planned
- Rewrite code so that bonds may have varying settlement dates
- Write final report

### Completed
- Rewrote code so that bonds may have varying settlement dates (not completely bug-proof)
- Wrote final report

## Progress evidence
- Repo/branch: https://github.com/T3nnysonz/zar-govi-curve
- Key commits / PRs:
- Screenshots:
  - Attached
  - Removed 'settlement date' parameter
  - Added settlement date information as csv columns

## Technical notes
- Figured out a small issue with the standard discount factor calculation formula:
$$ DF = \frac{DP-PV}{FC}$$
is incomplete when bonds may have varying settlement dates. A better equation is:
$$ DF = DF_g\times\frac{DP-PV}{FC}$$
With:
- $DF$ is the discount factor of interest
- $DP$ is the dirty price of the bond
- $PV$ is the present value of the bond
- $FC$ is the final cashflow of the bond (coupon + principal)
- $DF_g$ is the discount factor at the settlement date of the bond used in the above calculation. When all bonds have the same settlement date, $DF_g$ always equals 1, which is why there was no issue found until this point.

## Issues / Risks / Blockers
- I was still unable to get the discrepancy between my bootstrap values and Murex values within a good tolerance.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Not applicable, I have requested the day off to check into my university res.

## Time log
- 07:30:00-11:15 -Implementing variable settlement date
- 12:00-13:00 Writing final report
- 14:00-16:00 - Trying and failing to improve bootstrapping results.
