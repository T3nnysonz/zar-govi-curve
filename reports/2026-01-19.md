# Daily Report - 2026-01-19

## Summary
- Finished Webapp skeleton
- Created user input fields
- Wrote docs/architecture.md
- Completed day 7 tasks
- Mostly completed day 8 tasks

## Planned vs Done
### Planned

- Decide stack (recommend Streamlit unless there is a strong reason for separate frontend/backend).
- Define minimal user stories: “upload bond inputs and get a curve and charts”.
- Implement app skeleton: page layout, input widgets, placeholder output sections.
- Add docs/architecture.md with a Mermaid diagram.

### Completed

- Decide stack (recommend Streamlit unless there is a strong reason for separate frontend/backend).
- Define minimal user stories: “upload bond inputs and get a curve and charts”.
- Implement app skeleton: page layout, input widgets, placeholder output sections.
- Add docs/architecture.md with a Mermaid diagram.
- Wired UI input -> parsing/validation -> bootstrap -> output.
- Displayed parsed input table; curve pillar table (date, t, DF, zero); plots.
- Added error handling.
- Added export buttons: download curve as CSV; download plots.
- Added configuration panel: day count, compounding, interpolation method.

## Technical notes
- Learnt streamlit library
- Improved the efficiency of several functions
- Decided to make significant structural progress on days 7 and 8 temporarily sacrificing good UI to do so

## Issues / Risks / Blockers
- I am still unsure if the outputs of all my code is correct.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Improve performance (day 8 task)
- Improve UI and increase user friendliness
- Improve documentation
- Begin day 9 tasks
