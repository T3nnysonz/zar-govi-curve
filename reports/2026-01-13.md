## Summary:
-	Completed curve_concepts.md
-	Coded and implemented Log-DF interpolator
-	Tested the curve interpolator on simple toy data
-	Connected VSCode environment to GitHub

## Planned vs Done
### Planned:
-	Write docs/curve_concepts.md: zero curve vs par/yield curve; discount factor curve as the primary object; interpolation choices and tradeoffs.
-	Implement a curve object: store pillar times and discount factors.

### Done:
-	Write docs/curve_concepts.md: zero curve vs par/yield curve; discount factor curve as the primary object; interpolation choices and tradeoffs.
-	Implement a curve object: store pillar times and discount factors.

## Progress Evidence:
- [T3nnysonz/zar-govi-curve](https://github.com/T3nnysonz/zar-govi-curve)
- A screenshot of the output of the plotter is attached in this email.
 

## Technical Notes:
-	Learned what: zero-rates, par yields, and pillars are.
-	Used the Log-DF interpolation technique due to simple implementation, guaranteed positive df’’s.

## Issues:
-	none

## Plan for Tomorrow:
-	Write docs/bond_pricing.md: cashflow schedule and coupon conventions (document assumptions); clean vs dirty price; accrued interest.
-	Implement cashflow generator for fixed coupon bonds; bond PV from discount factors; accrued interest and dirty price.
## Time log:
-	08:00-12:00: researching and writing curve_concepts.md
-	13:00-16:00: Coding the Log-DF interpolator.
