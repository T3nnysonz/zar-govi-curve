# Daily Report - 2026-01-14

## Summary
- Researched and wrote docs/bond_pricing.md
- Wrote src/bonds.py
- Tested src/bonds.py

## Planned vs Done
### Planned

- 	Write docs/bond_pricing.md: cashflow schedule and coupon conventions (document assumptions); clean vs dirty price; accrued interest.
-	Implement cashflow generator for fixed coupon bonds; bond PV from discount factors; accrued interest and dirty price (simplified is fine if stated).

### Completed

- 	Wrote docs/bond_pricing.md: cashflow schedule and coupon conventions (document assumptions); clean vs dirty price; accrued interest.
-	Implemented cashflow generator for fixed coupon bonds; bond PV from discount factors; accrued interest and dirty price (simplified is fine if stated).

## Progress evidence
- Repo/branch: https://github.com/T3nnysonz/zar-govi-curve

## Technical notes (what you learned / decisions made)
- Learnt: Object Oriented Programming in Python.
- Learnt: Coupons are issued at fixed points in the year, rather than at points relative to the issueing of a bond.
- Learnt: How various industries account for payment days falling on non-business days
- Learnt: Clean and Dirty prices.
- Decision: Converted curves.py into a object oriented program to allow for the creation of a discount curve object that can be referenced in multiple methods without needing to make a new one every time.
- Decision: When coding the calcDF(t) method, (which was meant to be done yesterday) I used log-linear interpolation between the datapoints.

## Issues / Risks / Blockers
-  Still using a large number of simplifying assumptions

## Plan for tomorrow
- 	Write docs/bootstrap.md: step-by-step bootstrap from shortest maturity to longest; how coupon bond bootstrapping solves for the last DF given previous DFs.
-	Implement bootstrap_govi_curve(bonds, settlement_date, conventions): sort by maturity; for each bond, PV known cashflows using existing DFs; solve remaining DF for maturity cashflow.
-	Add basic data validation and helpful error messages.

## Simplifications and Assumptions

### Accrued Interest Calculation
- Uses linear interpolation to calculate accrued interest between coupon dates.
- Assumes coupon periods are exact fractions of a year.
- Assumes unadjusted coupon dates.

### Cash Flow Generation
- Calculates cashflows from maturity date backward. (Idea credited to DeepSeek)
- Assumes regular intervals

### Settlement
- Assumes unadjusted settlement dates.

## Time log (optional but encouraged)
- 08:00-10:00 - Writing bond_pricing.md
- 10:00-12:00 - Writing and testing bonds.py
- 13:00-15:00 - Refining bonds.py
