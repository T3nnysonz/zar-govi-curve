# Daily Report - 2026-01-15

## Summary
- Understood bootstrapping logic and wrote docs/bootstrap.md
- Wrote bootstrap.py with implemented bootstrap_govi_curve.
- Tested bootstrap.py on test_bootstrap.py
- Used some testing data to create bootstrap_demo.py
- Begun basic data validation

## Planned vs Done
### Planned
-	Write docs/bootstrap.md: step-by-step bootstrap from shortest maturity to longest; how coupon bond bootstrapping solves for the last DF given previous DFs.
-	Implement bootstrap_govi_curve(bonds, settlement_date, conventions): sort by maturity; for each bond, PV known cashflows using existing DFs; solve remaining DF for maturity cashflow.
-	Add basic data validation and helpful error messages.

### Completed
- Wrote docs/bootstrap.md
- Implemented bootstrap_govi_curve(bonds, settlement_date, conventions)

## Progress evidence
- Repo/branch: https://github.com/T3nnysonz/zar-govi-curve

## Technical notes
- Learned: Full bootstrapping logic
- Decided: to add a dummy and simplified dirty bond calculation to aid with bootstrapping implementation (Eventually regressed back to proper calculation)

## Issues / Risks / Blockers
- It took a significant amount of effort to debug my bootstrapper
- Consequently I have not at all thoroughly done data validation

## Plan for tomorrow
- Complete day 5 tasks
- Finsih data validation
- Improve general documentation

## Time log
- 08:00 - 10:30 : Writing bootstrapping.md
- 10:30 - 12:30 : Writing bootstrap.py
- 13:30 - 16:00 : Debugging bootstrap.py
