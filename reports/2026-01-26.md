## Technical notes
- While I am still unsure of the specifics, I may have to allow for "FRA" as a bond price.

## Issues / Risks / Blockers
- The bootsrapper is still not accurate enough for large prinicpal bonds. The future value R1 000 000 may be off by up to roughly R2 000.
- I am being slowed down by my complete lack of knowledge of the related finance.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Complete research of bond types.
- Begin implementing Forward Rate Agreements
