# Daily Report - 2026-01-16

## Summary
- Consolidated week 1 docs
- validated data
- added configurable conventions and bounds
- begun web app skeleton

## Planned vs Done
### Planned
- Add interpolation method choice (robust default: log-linear on discount factors).
- Add plots: DF(t), zero(t)
- Add sanity checks: DFs decreasing with maturity; no negative DFs; configurable rate bounds.
- Consolidate Week 1 docs and link them from README.md.


### Completed
- Added interpolation method choice.
- Added plots: DF(t), zero(t)
- Added sanity checks: DFs decreasing with maturity; no negative DFs; configurable rate bounds.
- Consolidated Week 1 docs and linked them from README.md.

## Progress evidence
- Repo/branch: https://github.com/T3nnysonz/zar-govi-curve
- Screenshots:
  - Attached with this document

## Technical notes
- Learnt basic Streamlit syntax
- 

## Issues / Risks / Blockers
- Poor understanding of streamlit is limiting my ability to create the web app
- there is a small bug with the zero curve plot

## Plan for tomorrow
- Complete web app skeleton

## Time log
- 08:00-11:00 - Data validation, Implementing a method to plot zero curves, allowing for customisation
- 12:00-13:00 - Consolidating documentation
- 13:00-16:30 - Creating Web-App skeleton
