# Daily Report - 2026-01-20

## Summary
- Improved UX
- Decluttered code
- Validated test data against Murex in test_bootstrap.py

## Planned vs Done
### Planned
- Improve performance
- Improve UI and increase user friendliness
- Improve documentation
- Begin day 9 tasks

### Completed
- Slightly improved performance
- Improved UI and increased user friendliness
- Improved code documentation
- Added tests for toy data
- Added test against murex data.

## Progress evidence
- Repo/branch: https://github.com/T3nnysonz/zar-govi-curve
- Screenshots:
  - Attached is a comparison of murex bootstrapping data vs my bootstrapping data. Currently only for dev viewing and thus difficult to read.

## Technical notes
- 

## Issues / Risks / Blockers
- Bootstrapping relative to Murex, while relatively successful, does not clear strict tolerances. Relative differences between expected and actual discount factors reach up to 3% in the long run while the relative differences between expected and actual zero rates is lackluster (5%) at short time intervals before drastically improving over longer time intervals. (<1%)

## Plan for tomorrow
- write docs/murex_validation.md. including Murex comparison methods and results of comparison
- write docs/dev_guide.md including how to runt tests, run the app, and the overall project structure.
- polish documentation
- try reduce gap between Murex data and my data

## Time log (optional but encouraged)
- 08:00 - 11:30 : Refining code and user experience and coding tests
- 12:30 - 16:30 : Coding tests.
