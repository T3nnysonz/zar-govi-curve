# Daily Report - 2026-01-27

## Summary
- Gained conceptual understanding of swaps and FRAs
- implemented bootstrapping algorithms for swaps and FRAs
- refactored many files and documents for general instruments

## Planned vs Done
### Planned
- Complete research of instrument types.
- Begin implementing Forward Rate Agreements

### Completed
- Completed research of instrument types.
- Implemented Forward Rate Agreements.
- Implemented swaps

## Progress evidence
- Repo/branch: https://github.com/T3nnysonz/zar-govi-curve
- Screenshots:
  - Changed CSV format again, now takes instrument type

## Technical notes
- Learned new instrument types
- I am still using bonds instead of swaps in my CSVs as the code for swaps is incomplete and currently inferior to the code for bonds
- Swap bootstrapping is currently using an approximate formula

## Issues / Risks / Blockers
- Slight spike in Zero Rate error at t=3 years against Murex dataset.
- The slight spike can be fixed by declaring the instruments after the second year as swaps, however due to the simplistic bootstrapping algorithm, the curve diverges at later time pillars in that case.
- While I conceptually understand FRAs and swaps, I do not understand the origin of the formulas used to bootstrap them. I.e. my understanding of FRAs and swaps is insufficient.
- Most files and docs have been written under the assumption that only bonds are being bootstrapped. Thus they are now outdated.

## Plan for tomorrow
- Inprove swap bootstrapping
- Re-write documents
